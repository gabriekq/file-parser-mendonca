
I create this program to exemplify one-parse file operations,
which include an end-point that read json files and record both file and the fileÂ´s information. 
The application also display the files saved in the database through and allowed it to download. 
I implement at this version the pagination that limits the rows per page. 

-the HTML without any data is load first, then the java script code in the page loads the data by call another end-point responsible to give the json data to finally fetch the table.

- the 3th version includes the search approach, that works by typing the id in this format 4-10 or just the id number like 4, the opposite also works 10-4.- 

- When the search field goes back to the original state "", the first page is displaying for the user.
